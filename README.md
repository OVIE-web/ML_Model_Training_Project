# ML_Model_Training_Project
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a flexible framework for training multiple ML models, optimizing them, and visualizing their performance. It uses popular libraries such as `numPy`  ,`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. A special emphasis is placed on comparing models to identify the best-performing one for the dataset.

### Features:
- Train and evaluate a variety of ML models (e.g., Nerual Network, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, etc.).
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation.
- Plot model evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
- Colab Notebook for user-friendly training and evaluation workflows.

## Dataset
You can use any dataset relevant to your problem. Make sure to preprocess your data (e.g., handle missing values, scale features) before using the training scripts.
